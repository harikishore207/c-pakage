Test Case 1: Basic Scenario

Input:
- Number of processes (p): 3
- Number of resources (r): 4
- Maximum resources for each instance: 5 4 7 3
- Maximum resource table:
  
  7 5 3 2
  3 2 2 2
  9 0 2 2
  
- Allocated resource table:
  
  0 1 0 1
  2 0 0 0
  3 0 2 2
  
  
Expected Output:
- The system should be in a safe state.
- The safe sequence should be displayed.

### Test Case 2: Unsafe State

Input:
- Number of processes (p): 3
- Number of resources (r): 4
- Maximum resources for each instance: 5 4 7 3
- Maximum resource table:
  
  7 5 3 2
  3 2 2 2
  9 0 2 2
  
- Allocated resource table:
  
  0 1 0 1
  2 0 0 0
  5 0 2 2
  
  
Expected Output:
- The system should be in an unsafe state.
- An appropriate message should be displayed.

### Test Case 3: Requests within Available Resources

Input:
- Number of processes (p): 3
- Number of resources (r): 4
- Maximum resources for each instance: 5 4 7 3
- Maximum resource table:
  
  7 5 3 2
  3 2 2 2
  9 0 2 2
  
- Allocated resource table:
  
  0 1 0 1
  2 0 0 0
  3 0 2 2
  
- Additional request for resources:
  
  0 0 1 0
  2 1 0 2
  0 0 1 0
  
  
Expected Output:
- The system should be in a safe state after the resource request.
- The safe sequence should be displayed.

### Test Case 4: Requests exceeding Maximum Claim

Input:
- Number of processes (p): 3
- Number of resources (r): 4
- Maximum resources for each instance: 5 4 7 3
- Maximum resource table:
  
  7 5 3 2
  3 2 2 2
  9 0 2 2
  
- Allocated resource table:
  
  0 1 0 1
  2 0 0 0
  3 0 2 2
  
- Additional request for resources:
  
  0 0 5 0
  2 1 0 2
  0 0 1 0
  
  
Expected Output:
- The system should reject the request as it exceeds the maximum claim.
- An appropriate message should be displayed.

### Test Case 5: Random Input

Input:
- Number of processes (p): 4
- Number of resources (r): 3
- Maximum resources for each instance: 6 5 4
- Maximum resource table:
  
  4 3 2
  2 1 0
  5 4 3
  3 2 1
  
- Allocated resource table:
  
  2 1 1
  1 0 0
  3 3 2
  2 1 1
  
  
Expected Output:
- The system should be in a safe state.
- The safe sequence should be displayed.

These test cases cover various scenarios, including safe states, unsafe states, resource requests, and invalid requests. Adjust the input parameters and scenarios based on your specific requirements and implementation.
